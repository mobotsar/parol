# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

Be aware that this project is still v0.y.z which means that anything can change anytime:

>"4. Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable."

>(Semantic Versioning Specification)

But we try to mark incompatible changes with a new minor version.

## v0.6.0-pre - unreleased yet

* Implementing auto generation for expanded grammar

## v0.5.8 - 2022-02-03

* Included PR #13: *Clap 3.0 (derive + builder styles)*. ***Thanks a lot to oaleaf.***
  This closes Issue #10

## v0.5.7 - 2022-01-22

* New examples [Keywords](./examples/keywords) and [Keywords2](./examples/keywords2) to demonstrate
handling of keywords in `parol`'s scanner
* Compiling more test grammars in `run_parsers.ps1`. Also negative cases are checked.
* Factored out grammar transformation from the parser to the module transformation

## v0.5.6 - 2022-01-10

* Even better integration of tools, i.e. subcommands with `clap`. Preparation for planned switch
over to `clap v3`.
* Fixed issue #4: *It appears the --only-lookahead option (-c) doesn't work*. This option is useless
and was removed.
* Builder: Write out a preliminary version of the expanded grammar after parsing to support grammars
that fail later checks.
* Added CONTRIBUTING.md
* Consolidated Public API (fixes #11)
* Updated documentation
  * Using `parol` like an installed tool in example invocations instead of
`cargo run --bin parol -- ...` now
  * Fixed links in cargo's doc output
* Improved termination behavior of the language generation feature (`parol generate`) introduced in
v0.5.3
* Improved error report (Undeclared variable) in example `calc`

## v0.5.5 - 2022-01-05

* Included PR #8: *Rename default actions file from grammar.rs -> grammar_trait.rs*. ***Thanks a lot
 to Techcable***

## v0.5.4 - 2022-01-05

* Fixed a serious bug in parsing groups, repetitions and optionals introduced in commit [6476e75].
* Started issuing more detailed miette-like errors from parol itself.
* Fixed an invalid generation of the %pop() instruction form '%pop' to '%pop()'.
* More tests to check the parol parser's internal representation.
* Fixed some problems related to platform specific newline characters.
* Fixed issues #5: *Bizarre error running scanner_states*. ***Thanks a lot to Techcable***
* Included PR #6: *Add API to invoke parol from build scripts*. ***Thanks a lot to Techcable***

## v0.5.3 - 2022-01-02

As of this version a detailed changelog is maintained to help people to keep track of changes that
have been made since last version of `parol`.

### Generation of sentences

An new tool (subcommand) `generate` was added to `parol` to generate a random sentence of a given
grammar.
You can use it this way:

```shell
    >parol generate -f ./examples/json/json-exp.par
{ "\r" : "uA7Fcu8a4A񚥚\r" , "\b\f\nuD1C0u5daf\b" : null , "\n\/\f𘃈򘱵" : true , "\\󸽿\\\\uCfC4𚍑𞱁uD852" : "\b\buEA01\\" } 
```

I already found some quirks in a few regular expressions 😉.

Also you can run endless stress tests like in this example using a *powershell* one-liner:

```powershell
for (;;) {parol generate -f ./examples/json/json-exp.par | Set-Content "$env:Temp/x.json"; json_parser "$env:Temp/x.json"; if (-not $?) { break } }
```

#### Acknowledge

This was possible with the help of the awesome
[rand_regex](https://github.com/kennytm/rand_regex.git) crate.

#### Disclaimer

On complex grammars the generation can get into deeply branching the grammar productions again and
again because productions are randomly selected. Therefore generation is aborted with an error if
the resulting sentence exceeds a certain limit. This limit currently defaults to a string length of
100 000. This value can be overwritten by giving an additional parameter after the grammar file.
If generation fails with error `parol::generators::language_generator::source_size_exceeded` please
give it another try.
